            <P>
                The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and 
                collaboration resource we have ever seen. 
                It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress.
                 It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared
                  humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people 
                  everywhere.
                <P>Over the last decade we have seen this promise
                     fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power
                      of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, 
                      promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality.
                       We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our
                        aspirations for the human experience of the internet.
                         We do so now.</P>
